Repositories package initialization.

This __init__.py file is intentionally left empty. Repositories are typically
imported directly from their specific modules (e.g.,
`from app.repositories.user_repository import user_repository`). This
approach helps manage dependencies and avoids potential circular imports
in a larger application.
