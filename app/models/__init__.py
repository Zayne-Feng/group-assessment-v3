"""
Models package initialization.

This __init__.py file is intentionally left empty to allow direct imports
of specific model classes from their respective modules (e.g.,
`from app.models.user import User`). This approach avoids circular
dependencies that can arise from importing all models into a single
__init__.py file in a larger application.
